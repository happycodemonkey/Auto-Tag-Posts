This module allows users to create posts from a node block that will be auto-tagged by that node's taxonomy terms. The vocabulary can be limited by the admin.

@TODOs:
1) Make the display more flexible. If the admin limits the tagging to only one vocabulary, the tagged post won't show up if the "parent" node is tagged with multiple vocabularies.
2) Allow the admin to specify more than one content type for the post, and present the user with a limited drop-down.
3) Don't display the block when it's not on a node at all. Not useful unless there's an NID.
4) Make sure the content types being tagged have tagging enabled!!!
