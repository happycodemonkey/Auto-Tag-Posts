This module allows users to create posts from a node block that will be auto-tagged by that node's taxonomy terms. The vocabulary can be limited by the admin.

@TODOs:
- Make the display more flexible. If the admin limits the tagging to only one vocabulary, the tagged post won't show up if the "parent" node is tagged with multiple vocabularies.
- Allow the admin to specify more than one content type for the post, and present the user with a limited drop-down.
- Make sure the content types being tagged have tagging enabled!!!
